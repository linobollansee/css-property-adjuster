## Features

### Existing Features

- The Header

  - At the top of the page, there is the header showcasing the name of the website and tool:
  CSS Property Adjuster. The deliberately chosen Arial font ensures simplicity and reliability, minimizing potential confusion while engaging with the input-controls designed to style the adjustable element on the page.

- The Input-controls

  - The main content of the page features input-controls enabling to customize the following CSS properties: width, height, margin, padding, border-radius, box-shadow, background, font-family, color, font-size, text-align, text-shadow, outline, letter-spacing, line-height, opacity, text-decoration, font-weight, border-width, border-style, border-color, visibility, overflow, and cursor.

- The Adjustable-element

  - The adjustable-element undergoes real-time updates and is automatically styled based on the current configuration of the input-controls.

- The CSS code

  - A designated box contains real-time updated CSS code corresponding to the configurations of the input-controls.

- The footer
  
  - Within the footer, there is a checkbox for alphabetically sorting the CSS code and another button for copying the generated CSS code to the clipboard. Upon clicking the "Copy to Clipboard" button, a JavaScript alert is triggered to confirm the action has occured.

### Features Left to Implement

- The prospect of incorporating supplementary controls presents an exciting opportunity to enhance the functionality of the CSS Property Adjuster, providing additional features to fine-tune the styling of the adjustable element. This potential integration holds the promise of a more versatile and comprehensive toolset, enabling users to exert greater precision and creativity.

- As innovative technology continues to advance, the introduction of new devices with custom resolutions creates new opportunities for the website's responsive design. The emergence of these devices prompts the refinement of media queries, enabling more precise and effective tailoring of content for diverse screen sizes and resolutions.

## Other General Project Advice

- During the development of a new feature, adopting an incremental and iterative approach proves advantageous for facilitating smoother development and simplifying the debugging process. Introducing too many features simultaneously increases the complexity too quickly, making it considerably more challenging to trace issues when something doesn't work as expected.

- Creating an ingenious JavaScript function or building an extensive JavaScript array demands a significant investment of time. It becomes crucial to protect them through the establishment of backups. Given the vulnerability of files to accidental overwriting during intense development, it underscores the necessity of maintaining multiple copies as a precautionary measure.

- Employing consistent comments in your code that closely mirror your commit messages is a commendable practice. This alignment facilitates a streamlined development process, allowing you to swiftly locate specific code sections by simply utilizing the CTRL-F search function. The parallel structure of comments and commit messages enhances code readability and aids in maintaining a cohesive and easily navigable codebase.
